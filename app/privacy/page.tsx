        This Privacy Policy covers the use of the Klosanow website (the
        &quot;Site&quot;) and the products, software, data feeds, and services
        (collectively with the Site, the &quot;Service&quot;) provided by

        The term &quot;Personal Information&quot;, as used in this Privacy
        Policy, refers to any information that can be used to identify a
        specific person, or any anonymous information (e.g. IP address) that is
        linked to a specific person. Personal Information does not include
        information that has been aggregated or made anonymous such that it can
        no longer be reasonably associated with a specific person. This policy
        in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate
        information, and we may share aggregate data about our users with third
        parties for various purposes.

        personally. In addition, if we suspect criminal activity, we may share
        our server logs with the appropriate investigative authorities who could
        use that information to trace and identify you.

        necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Klosanow, our
        employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our
